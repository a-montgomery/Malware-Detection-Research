# Malware-Research
Abstract â€“ Android devices are the most popular
mobile device on the market. The prevalence of
Android devices has drawn the attention of
malicious actors and are now a primary target for
malware developers. Malware developers have
developed numerous techniques to penetrate
Android devices and avoid detection. Malware
detection methods have also evolved to maintain
pace with malware developers.
This paper contributes a comprehensive review of
Android malware and associated detection
methods. To understand the threat that malware
poses to Android users, we believe it is important
to understand the most significant threats currently
available and the penetration methods that are
being used to infect devices. With that information,
a review of existing and emerging detection
methods can be analyzed to aid in the
determination of the best potential salutation for
protecting Android devices from malware.
